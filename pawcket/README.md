# PetPaw - Pet Management App Prototype

A high-fidelity prototype for a smart pet management application built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

PetPaw is a comprehensive pet management application designed to help pet owners track their pet's health, schedule tasks, connect with other pet owners, and more. This prototype showcases the UI/UX design and interaction flow of the application.

## Features

- **Home Dashboard**: View pet information, health stats, and upcoming tasks at a glance
- **Pet Profile**: Detailed pet information including health records, diet, and behavior
- **Social Interaction**: Connect with nearby pet owners and share pet-related content
- **Task Management**: Schedule and track pet care tasks like feeding, medication, and grooming
- **Settings**: Customize app preferences, notification settings, and connected devices

## Screens

The prototype includes the following screens:

1. **Home** (home.html): Main dashboard with pet summary and upcoming tasks
2. **Pet Profile** (profile.html): Detailed pet information and health records
3. **Social** (social.html): Social feed and nearby pets for interaction
4. **Tasks** (tasks.html): Task management and scheduling
5. **Settings** (settings.html): App settings and user preferences

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Font Awesome icons
- Responsive design (iPhone 15 Pro dimensions)

## How to View

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see all screens displayed in iPhone-style frames
2. Each screen can also be viewed individually by opening the respective HTML file

## Design Considerations

- Modern UI with card-based layout for easy information scanning
- iOS-inspired design elements (status bar, tab bar, rounded corners)
- Consistent color scheme with primary accent color (#ff6b6b)
- Intuitive navigation with bottom tab bar
- Real images from Unsplash for enhanced visual appeal

## Future Development

This prototype can be extended to a fully functional application by:

1. Implementing JavaScript functionality for interactive elements
2. Connecting to a backend database for data storage
3. Adding authentication for user accounts
4. Implementing real-time notifications
5. Developing native mobile versions using frameworks like React Native or Flutter
